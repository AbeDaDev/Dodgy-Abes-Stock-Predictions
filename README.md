📈 Stock Prediction App (In Progress)

This is a work-in-progress stock prediction app that generates a detailed report based on the stock a user searches for. The app leverages both the OpenAI API and a stock market data API to provide insightful, AI-generated summaries and real-time stock information.

This project is part of the Scrimba AI Engineering Path, and it’s helping me deepen my understanding of how REST APIs and AI models interact. It’s also improved my ability to structure user input, process API responses through OpenAI, and display useful data in a clean, responsive UI.
